## Useful Stuff in ES6

ES2015, or ECMAScript 2015, is the first significant update to the language since ES5 was initially released in 2009. You'll often see ES2015 called by its original name, ES6, since it's the 6th version of ECMAScript. [Check out all the cool new stuff in ES6](http://es6-features.org/#Constants)! Let's take a look at the most value-added improvements:

[var let and const](http://www.react.express/block_scoped_declarations)
>the [babel] compiled output replaces const and let with var. You'll also notice that Babel transforms const a = 3 into var _a = 3. This is so that your code can run on older platforms that don't support the new block-scoped variable declarations.

[Fat arrow functions](http://www.react.express/fat_arrow_functions)
>The fat arrow `=>` is used to define anonymous functions. There are two important differences in the behavior of these functions, compared to functions defined with `function`.

>If the function body is not wrapped in curly braces (as in the previous sentences), it is executed as an expression, and the return value of the function is the value of the expression. The function body can be wrapped in curly braces to make it a block, in which case you will need to explicitly `return` a value, if you want something returned.

[Destructuring](http://www.react.express/destructuring)
>Destructuring is a convenient way to extract multiple keys from an object or array simultaneously and assign the values to local variables.

[Imports and exports](http://www.react.express/imports_and_exports)
>There is one default export per file, and this exported value can be imported without refering to it by name. Every other import and export must be named.

[Default Parameters](http://www.react.express/default_parameters)

```javascript
const printInput = (input = 'hello world') => {
  console.log(input)
}

printInput()
printInput('hello universe')
```

[Classes](http://www.react.express/classes)
>In ES5, classes are written as functions, with instance methods assigned to `MyFunction.prototype`. ES2015 allows us to use the simpler `class` syntax.

>`class` gives us built in instance functions, static functions, and inheritance. `constructor` is a special function that is called automatically every time a class instance is created. We can use the static keyword to declare `static` class functions. Static method calls are made directly on the class and cannot be called on instances of the class.

```javascript
// Class Instance Property

class Cat {
  name = 'Tom'
  state = {
    running: true
  }

  constructor() {
    console.log(this.name, this.state.running)
  }
}

new Cat()

```

```javascript
// Static class property
class Foo {
  static bar = 'hello'
}

console.log(Foo.bar)
```

[Bound Instance Method](http://www.react.express/bound_instance_methods)
>Before ES2016, you might bind functions to class instances in the `constructor`, e.g. `this.func = this.func.bind(this)`. Binding here ensures that a class's instance function is invoked with the correct context.

```javascript
class Cat {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name
  }
  printName = () => {
    console.log(this.name)
  }
}

const cat = new Cat('Tom')
const printName = cat.printName

// 'this' is still bound to our Cat instance, so even
// though our calling context changed, the function
// executes in its original context.
printName()
```

[Dynamic Object Keys](http://www.react.express/dynamic_object_keys)
[Array Spread](http://www.react.express/array_spread)
[Object Spread](http://www.react.express/object_spread)
>We can copy an object simply with `{...originalObj}`. Note that this is a shallow copy. We can also extend an object with `{...originalObj, key1: 'newValue'}`.


## Gotchas

### ParseInt

Always use the radix parameter to specify how to parse int. When radix is unspecified, `parseInt` assumes you want to parse by base 10:

```javascript
parseInt('10') //> 10

// which is equivalent to
parseInt('10', 10) //> 10
```

We can parse by base 2 or base 16

```javascript
parseInt('10', 2) //> 2
parseInt('10, 16') //> 2
parseInt('A', 16) //> 10
parseInt('A', 10) //> NaN
```

### Callback Hell
**Callback hell**, which refers to deeply nested spaghetti code that jumps all over the place, is a common problem with asynchronous code that impedes developer productivity. How do we fix the callback hell problem?  Here are some workarounds:

**Modularize your code**

Instead of writing all your code in a deeply nested anonymous function in your async code, try taking that stuff out into a separate function.

**Use `async-await`**

Node [provides out-of-the-box support](https://hackernoon.com/6-reasons-why-javascripts-async-await-blows-promises-away-tutorial-c7ec10518dd9) for `async-await`.

Google provides a good [primer on async](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/async-functions).

	Async functions work like this:

	```javascript
	async function myFirstAsyncFunction() {
	  try {
	    const fulfilledValue = await promise;
	  }
	  catch (rejectedValue) {
	    // …
	  }
	}

	```
[Async and Await](http://www.react.express/async_await)
>We can use the `async` keyword before a function name to wrap the return value of this function in a `Promise`. We can use the `await` keyword (in an `async` function) to wait for a promise to be resolved or rejected before continuing code execution in this block.

```javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
  return fetch('https://randomuser.me/api/')
}

const printData = async () => {
  try {
    const data = await fetchData()
    const json = await data.json()
    console.log(json)
  } catch(e) {
    console.error("Problem", e)
  }
}

printData()
```

Here's how you integrate the async-await into your React component (make sure you install `isomorphic-fetch` first:

```javascript
callApi = async () => {
   const response = await fetch('/api/hello');
   const body = await response.json();

   if (response.status !== 200) throw Error(body.message);
   return body;
  };
  componentDidMount() {
    this.callApi()
      .then(res => this.setState({ response: res.express }))
      .catch(err => console.log(err));
  }

```


**Promise**

* Use `Promise`, which is natively supported by ES6. Check out [the google tutorial](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises) on `Promise`.
* See [Scotch.io Tutorial for Promise](https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-promises-for-dummies)

>Async functions - making promises friendly

### Loosely Typed Javascript
JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don’t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. Many other languages, like Java (which is completely different from JavaScript), require you to declare a variable’s type, such as int, float, boolean, or String.

JavaScript, however, automatically types a variable based on what kind of information you assign to it (e.g., that `''` or `""` indicate string values).

**typeof**

whenever a variable’s type is in doubt, you can employ the `typeof` operator:

```javascript
typeof 1 //> "number"
typeof "1" //> "string"
typeof [1,2,3] //> "object"
typeof {"name": "john", "country": "usa"} //> "object"
typeof [{"name": "john", "country": "usa"}, {"name": "mary", "country": "uk"}] //> "object"

typeof trye //> "boolean"
typeof (1 === 1) //> "boolean"

typeof undefined //> "undefined"
typeof null //> "object"

const f = () => 2
typeof f //> "function"
```

**`==` vs `===`**
The 3 equal signs mean "equality without type coercion". Using the triple equals, the values must be equal in type as well.

```javascript
1 == "1" //> true
1 === "1" //> false
```

```javascript
null == undefined //> true
null === undefined //> false
```

```javascript
'0' == false //> true
'0' === false //> false
```

```javascript
0 == false   //> true
0 === false  //> false, because they are of a different type
```

**Null versus Undefined versus 0**

```javascript
!0 //> true
!null //> true
!undefined //true
```

```javascript
typeof undefined //> "undefined"
typeof null //> "object"

undefined == null //> true
undefined === null //> false

isNaN(1 + undefined) // true
isNaN(1 + null)  // false
1 + null //> 1

!null //> true
!undefined //> true
```

```javascript
let users = [
   {"name": "andrew", "country": "usa"},
   {"name": "mary"}
]

// execute this code and it'll print out:
//> andrew is from usa
//> mary has no country
users.forEach( u => {
	if(u.country  == null) {
		console.log(u.name + " has no country")
	}
	else {
		console.log(u.name + " is from "+ u.country)
	}

})

// execute this code and it'll print out:
//> andrew is from usa
//> mary is from undefined
users.forEach( u => {
	if(u.country  === null) {
		console.log(u.name + " has no country")
	}
	else {
		console.log(u.name + " is from "+ u.country)
	}
})

```

Why did the second `forEach` loop fail to print correctly? Because `u.country` returns `undefined` when no country is defined for the second user.


My advice is to always use `===` since that is a more thorough check and help you avoid nasty bugs. `==` is a convenient way to checking error conditions if you're not sure if the failed operation returns `undefined` or `null` but don't do that. If you are not sure about `undefined` or `null`, then check for both:

```javascript
if(u.country === undefined || u.country === null)
//OR better
if(!u.country)
```

### Scoping in JavaScript
Many languages use block-level scope, in which variables exist only within the current “block” of code, usually indicated by curly braces (`{ }`).

In JavaScript, however, variables `var` are scoped at the function level, meaning they are accessible anywhere within the function (not block) in which they reside.

**Variable Hoisting**

JavaScript code is usually, but not always, executed in linear, top-to-bottom order. For example, in this code, the variable `i` is actually declared before the for-loop even begins. This phenomenon is called variable hoisting. Variable declarations are hoisted up to the top of the function context in which they reside.

```javascript
for (var i = 0; < a.length;  i++) {
    console.log(a[i]);
}
```
ES6 introduced `let`, which lets you create [block-scoped variables without hoisting](http://es6-features.org/#BlockScopedVariables):

```javascript
for (let i = 0; < a.length;  i++) {
    console.log(a[i]);
}
```

### Global Variables
`window` is the topmost object in the browser’s hierarchy of JavaScript elements, and all of these objects and values you see beneath window exist at the global level. What this means is that every time you declare a new variable, you are adding a new value to `window`. This is really bad because we don't want to pollute the global namespace.

There are two easy workarounds:

* Declare variables only within other functions. This is not usually feasible, but the function-level scope will prevent local variables from conflicting with others.
* Declare a single global object, and attach all of your would-be global variables to that object. For example:

	```javascript
	var Vis = {};  //Declare empty global object
	Vis.zebras = "still pretty amazing"
	Vis.monkeys = "too funny LOL"
	Vis.fish = "you know, not bad"
	```

## Array and String Functions

See [Mutating vs Nonmutating array operation](https://lorenstewart.me/2017/01/22/javascript-array-methods-mutating-vs-non-mutating/)

Check out [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#range) and underscore for useful array operators.

### Add things to array

* `array.push()` adds an item to the end of the array
* `array.unshift()` adds an item to the beginning of the array.

```javascript
// since the array will be mutated,
// use 'let' rather than 'const'
let mutatingAdd = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];

mutatingAdd.push('f'); // ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
mutatingAdd.unshift('z'); // ['z', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' 'f']
```
### Common Algo:

Match parentheses in a string.

```javascript
function isBalanced(str, openCnt) {
console.log('str = ', str)
	if (str === undefined || str === null || typeof str !== 'string') {
		return false;
    } else if (openCnt <  0) {
		return false;
	} else if( str.length === 0 && openCnt === 0) {
		return true;
	}

	const fst = str[0];
	const rst = str.slice(1);
	return isBalanced(rst, newOpenCnt(fst, openCnt));
}

const newOpenCnt = (c, openCnt) => {
	if(c === '(') return openCnt + 1;
	if(c === ')') return openCnt - 1;
	return openCnt;
}
```

## Create array dynamically
```
var vals = Array.from({length: 13}, (v,i) => i)
//> (13) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

vals = vals.map(v => v-1)
//> (13) [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

vals.map(v => ({val: v, : valIncrementer(v, false), disabled: valIncrementer(v, true) }))
```

### Get stuff from an array

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const [first, second] = arr;
```

### Get last elem of an array

Don't use `pop` unless you want to mutate the array:

```javascript
var arr = [1,2,3]
arr.pop() //>3
arr //>[1, 2] ... Very Bad. Your original array got changed

const arr2 = [1,2,3]
arr2.pop()
arr2 //> Even const can't help you

const arr3 = arr
arr3.pop() //>2
arr //> [1] ... arr got changed even though arr3 did the pop
```

Do this instead:

```javascript
let arr = [1,2,3]
arr.slice(-1)[0] //> 3
arr //> [1, 2, 3]
```

More on `Array.slice`:

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3]
arr.slice(-1) //> [3]
arr.slice(0) //> [1, 2, 3]
arr.slice(1) //> [2, 3]
arr.slice(2) //> [3]
```

**Combine things in array**

```javascript
[0, 1, 2, 3].reduce((sum, value) => { sum + value;}, 0);
//> total is 6
```

```javascript
["hello","World"].reduce( (a, res) => a + res ) //> "helloWorld"

["hello","World"].reduce( (a, res) => { return a + res }, "My message: " )
//> "My message: helloWorld"
```

```javascript
['a','b','c'].join("") //> "abc"
['a','b','c'].map(d => "1"+d).join(",") //> "1a,1b,1c"
```

If you don’t pass in an initial value, reduce will assume the first item in your array is your initial value.

**Combine sub-arrays**

```javascript
// Flat

const flat = (data) => data.reduce((total, amount) => {
  return total.concat(amount);
}, []);

var data = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
flat(data) // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]

```

**Flatmap**

Write a function that converts "hello" to "h.e.l.l.o." There're two parts to this: `flat` and `map`.


```javascript
const arr = "hello".split("") //> ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]

const matrix = arr.map(s => [s, "."])
// [Array(2), Array(2), Array(2), Array(2), Array(2)]
// 0: (2) ["h", "."]
// 1: (2) ["e", "."]
// 2: (2) ["l", "."]
// 3: (2) ["l", "."]
// 4: (2) ["o", "."]


const flat = (data) => data.reduce((res, d) => {
  return res.concat(d);
}, []);


flat(matrix) //> ["h", ".", "e", ".", "l", ".", "l", ".", "o", "."]

flat(matrix).join("") //> "h.e.l.l.o."

```

**Sorting**

```javascript
['a','c','b'].sort((a,b) => a > b) //> ["a", "b", "c"]

[1,3,2].sort((a,b) => a - b) //> [1, 2, 3]

[1,3,2].sort((a,b) => b - a) //> [3, 2, 1]

[1,3,2].sort((a,b) => b > a) //> [3, 2, 1]
```


**Getting Substrings**

Say we have "hello world" as our string but we only want "world". What do we do?

```javascript
// Option 1:  Split using RegExp, then slice and take the part of the array

"hello world".split(new RegExp("hello")) //> ["", ["", "world"]]
"hello world".split(new RegExp("hello")).slice(1) //> ["", "world"]
"hello world".split(new RegExp("hello")).slice(1)[1] //> "world"
```

```javascript
// Option 2:  Slice recursively. "hello" plus space is 6 characters
"hello world".slice(6) //> "world"
```

Option 2 using `slice` works because a string is really just an array of characters.


## Functions
Functions in JavaScript are objects. Objects are collections of name/value pairs having a hidden link to a prototype object. Objects produced from object literals are linked to Object.prototype. Function objects are linked to Function.prototype (which is itself linked to Object.prototype).


Since functions are objects, they can be used like any other value. Functions can be stored in variables, objects, and arrays. Functions can be passed as arguments to functions, and functions can be returned from functions. Also, since functions are objects, functions can have methods.


The function’s name is optional. The function can use its name to call itself recursively. The name can also be used by debuggers and development tools to identify the function. If a function is not given a name, as shown in the example below, it is said to be anonymous.

```javascript
// Create a variable called add and store a function
// in it that adds two numbers.
var add = function (a, b) {
	return a + b;
};
```
**Method Invocation**
When a function is stored as a property of an object, we call it a method. When a method is invoked, this is bound to that object. If an invocation expression con- tains a refinement (that is, a . dot expression or [subscript] expression), it is invoked as a method:

```javascript
var stooge = {
	firstName: "Jerome",
	lastName: "Howard",
	nickname: "Curley",
	age: 37,
	sing: function(subject) {
   		return "la la this is a song about "+ subject
	},
	introduceSelf: function() {
		return "my name is " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", but people call me "+ this.nickname
   },
   changeNickname: function(nickname) {
   		this.nickname = nickname;
   }
};
stooge.sing("frog") //> "la la this is a song about frog"

stooge.introduceSelf() //> "my name is Jerome Howard, but people call me Curley"

stooge.changeNickname("Jerry")
stooge.introduceSelf() //> "my name is Jerome Howard, but people call me Jerry"
```

A method can use this to access the object so that it can retrieve values from the object or modify the object. The binding of this to the object happens at invocation time. This very late binding makes functions that use this highly reusable. Methods that get their object context from this are called public methods.


```javascript
// Augment stooge object with an ageUp method.
stooge.ageUp = function() {
	var that = this;
	var helper = function() {
		that.age = that.age+1
	}
	helper();
}

// Augment stooge object with a displayAge method.
stooge.displayAge = function() { return this.age }


stooge.displayAge() //> 37
stooge.ageUp()
stooge.displayAge() //> 38
```

**Mistake in JavaScript's Language's Design**

When a function is not the property of an object, then it is invoked as a function:

```javascript
var sum = add(3, 4);    // sum is 7
```

When a function is invoked with this pattern, this is bound to the global object. This was a mistake in the design of the language. Had the language been designed correctly, when the inner function is invoked, this would still be bound to the `this` variable of the outer function. A consequence of this error is that a method cannot employ an inner function to help it do its work because the inner function does not share the method’s access to the object as its this is bound to the wrong value.


A bonus parameter that is available to functions when they are invoked is the `arguments` array. It gives the function access to all of the arguments that were supplied with the invocation, including excess arguments that were not assigned to parameters. This makes it possible to write functions that take an unspecified number of parameters:

```javascript
// Make a function that adds a lot of stuff.
// Note that defining the variable sum inside of
// the function does not interfere with the sum
// defined outside of the function. The function
// only sees the inner one.

var sum = function () { var i, sum = 0;
	for (i = 0; i < arguments.length; i += 1) {
		sum += arguments[i];
	}
	return sum;
};

// Invoke
document.writeln(sum(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42)); // 108

var array = [3, 4];
sum.apply(null, array);  //>  7

```

This is not a particularly useful pattern. In Chapter 6, we will see how we can add a similar method to an array.
Because of a design error, arguments is not really an array. It is an array-like object. arguments has a length property, but it lacks all of the array methods. We will see a consequence of that design error at the end of this chapter.


## Awesome JSON Stuff

**What is JSON**

JSON encodes data as key value pairs. It’s faster and easier to parse with JavaScript than XML.

**Creating JSON**

Dynamically

```javascript
// ES6 Syntax
[1,2,3].map(d => {
	return {[d]: -d}
});

// ES 5 Syntax
[1,2,3].map(d => {
	var tmp = {};
	tmp[d] = -d;
	return tmp;
});

// or
[1,2,3].map(d => ({[d]: -d}));

// yields
//> [{1: -1}, {2: -2}, {3: -3}]
```

Statically

```javascript
var stooge = {
   first_name: "Jerome",
   "last-name": "Howard"
};


var flight = {
   airline: "Oceanic",
   number: 815,
   departure: {
      IATA: "SYD",
      time: "2004-09-22 14:55",
       city: "Sydney"
   },
   arrival: {
      IATA: "LAX",
      time: "2004-09-23 10:42",
      city: "Los Angeles"
   }
};
```

A property’s name can be any string, including the empty string. The quotes around a property’s name in an object literal are optional if the name would be a legal JavaScript name and not a reserved word. So quotes are required around “last-name", but are optional around first_name. Commas are used to separate the pairs.

**Converting JSON from one form to another**

```javascript
// Create array of objects
var foo = [1,2,3].map(d => {
	return {[d]: null};
});

// Create object with original arrays as keys and null as the values
var bar = foo.reduce((acc, x) => {
	for (let key in x) acc[key] = x[key];
		return acc;
}, {});


```

**Retrieving Things from JSON**

```javascript
stooge.first_name //> “Jerome”
stooge[“last-name”] //> Howard
flight.departure.IATA  //> "SYD"
```


The undefined value is produced if an attempt is made to retrieve a non existent member:

```javascript
stooge["middle-name"]  //> undefined
flight.status   //> undefined
stooge["FIRST-NAME"]   //> undefined
```

The `||` operator can be used to fill in default values:

```javascript
var middle = stooge["middle-name"] || "(none)";
var middle = stooge["middle-name"] || "(none)”;
var status = flight.status || "unknown"
```

The `&&` operator can be used to guard against retrieving values from `undefined`

```javascript
flight.equipment //> undefined
flight.equipment.model //> throw "TypeError"
flight.equipment && flight.equipment.model //> undefined
```

**Update**
If the object does not already have that property name, the object is augmented:

```javascript
stooge.first_name = 'Jerome';
stooge['middle-name'] = 'Lester';
stooge.nickname = 'Curly';
```

**Prototype**
Create new object using old object as prototype:

```javascript
var anotherStooge = Object.create(stooge)
anotherStooge.first_name //> "Jerome"
anotherStooge.first_name = "Harry"
anotherStooge.first_name //> "Harry
```

You can think about the prototype as the default object. If we try to retrieve a property value from an object, and if the object lacks the property name, then JavaScript attempts to retrieve the property value from the prototype object.

The prototype relationship is a dynamic relationship. If we add a new property to a prototype, that property will immediately be visible in all of the objects that are based on that prototype:

```javascript
stooge.profession = "actor"
anotherStooge.profession //> "actor"
```

We can also delete:

```javascript
delete anotherStooge.first_name //> true
anotherStooge.first_name //> "Jerome"
```

**Add function to Prototype**

```javascript
stooge.sing = function() { return "la la la" }
anotherStooge.sing() //> "la la la"
```

```javascript
flight.hasOwnProperty('number')  // true
flight.hasOwnProperty('constructor')  // false
```

Functions in JavaScript are objects.

**Operations on JSON**

```javascript
let users = [
	{"name": "andrew", "country": "usa"},
	{"name": "mary"}
]
users[0] //> {name: "andrew", country: "usa"}
users[0].country //> "usa"
users[1].country //> undefined
users.filter(u => u.country !== null).map(u => u.username) //> ["xy"]

```

**Key operations**

Get all keys from JSON

```javascript
let foo = {"name": "andrew", "country": "usa"}
let keys = Object.keys(foo) //> [“name”, “country”]
```

**Unique Keys**

Get the value associated with the key

```javascript
let user = {"name": "andrew", "name": "usa"}
user.name //> "andrew"

```

Check if a key exists in a JSON

```javascript
let user = {"name": "andrew", "country": "usa"}
user.hasOwnProperty("name") //>true
user.hasOwnProperty("andrew") //> false
user.hasOwnProperty("country") //> true
user.hasOwnProperty("city") //> false
```

**JSON.stringify**

```javascript
var foo = {"name": "andrew", "country": "usa"};
var bar = {"name": "xiaoyun", "city": "dc" };
var baz = {"name": "andrew", "country": "usa"}
JSON.stringify(foo) == JSON.stringify(baz) //> true
JSON.stringify(foo) === JSON.stringify(baz) //> true
JSON.stringify(foo) == JSON.stringify(bar); //> false
```
Then you can use `indexOf` is an operation on a `string`.

```javascript
let a = JSON.stringify(foo) //> "{"name":"andrew","country":"usa”}"
a.indexOf("{") //> 0
a.indexOf("n") //> 2
a.indexOf("france") //> -1
a.indexOf("usaa") //> -1
a.indexOf("usa") //> 28
a.indexOf("u") //> 20
a.indexOf("sa") //> 29
a.indexOf("s") //> 29
a.indexOf("}") //> 32
```

**Swap Key and Val of JSON Objects**

```javascript
const objKey = (d, i) => Object.keys(d)[i]
const objVal = (d, i) => d[objKey(d,i)]

// create JSON from an array of keys

const swap = (data) => Object.keys(data).reduce( (obj,key) => {
   obj[ data[key] ] = key;
   return obj;
},{});


var data = {A : 1, B : 2, C : 3, D : 4}
var newData = swap(data)

console.log(newData); //> {1: "A", 2: "B", 3: "C", 4: "D"}

```


**Destructuring**
>Using object destructuring saves you from creating temporary references for those properties.

```javascript
var user = {firstName: "amy", lastName:"winehouse"}
var {firstName, lastName} = user
firstName //> "amy"
lastName //> "winehouse"

```

**Merging two JSON objects**

```javascript
let foo = {a: 'a', b: 'b'}
let bar = {c: 'c', d: 'd'}
let foobar = {...foo, ...bar} //> {a: "a", b: "b", c: "c", d: "d"}
```

### Practice

**Given**

```javascript
const data = [
  {a: 'happy', b: 'robin', c: ['blue','green']},
  {a: 'tired', b: 'panther', c: ['green','black','orange','blue']},
  {a: 'sad', b: 'goldfish', c: ['green','red']}
];

```

**Write a function to return all the unique colors from `data` as an array.** Hint: use the `flat` function from the above example.


# ES6 and how Babel helps
## Babel

* [What is Babel?](https://kleopetrov.me/2016/03/18/everything-about-babel/)

	>Babel is a highly configurable compiler that lets you use experimental JavaScript features and extensions, compiling down into older JavaScript versions that can be supported on a wider range of platforms. Of course, if a native platform doesn't support an ES2015 feature like Promise(), Babel won't fully be able to help -- but it can in many cases "polyfill" missing APIs to provide this functionality.
* [React Express Tutorial](http://www.react.express/modern_javascript)

	>ECMAScript is the language specification used to implement the JavaScript language. Nearly every JavaScript environment today can run at least ECMAScript 5 (ES5), the version of JavaScript introduced in 2009. However, there are many new features in the latest versions of JavaScript that we'd like to use. Thanks to Babel, we can use them today! Babel transforms newer features into ES5 for cross-platform compatibility.
* How to [set up Babel for react app](http://www.react.express/babel) or [set up Babel for node/express app](https://github.com/babel/example-node-server). For node app, assume you have this file structure:

	```
	my-app
	├───package.json
	├───.babelrc
	├───server
	│   ├───app.js <===ES6
	│   └───build
	|		 └───app.js <===ES5
	...
	```

	Add the following to `.babelrc`

	```
	{
	  "presets": [
	    "env",
	    "stage-2"
	  ],
	  "plugins": [
	    "transform-runtime"
	  ]
	}

	```
	Add the following to `package.json`:

	```
	"scripts": {
		"build": "babel server/app.js -o server/build/app.js",
    	"start": "nodemon server/app.js --watch server --exec babel-node",
    	"server": "nodemon server/server.js --watch server/app.js --exec babel-node"
	}
	"dependencies": {
		"express": "^4.16.2",
		"webpack": "^3.10.0"
	},
	"devDependencies": {
		"babel-cli": "^6.26.0",
		"babel-core": "^6.26.0",
		"babel-loader": "^7.1.2",
		"babel-plugin-transform-runtime": "^6.23.0",
		"babel-preset-env": "^1.6.1",
		"babel-preset-react": "^6.24.1",
		"babel-preset-stage-1": "^6.24.1",
		"babel-preset-stage-2": "^6.24.1",
		"eslint": "^3.19.0",
		"nodemon": "^1.14.11",
		"webpack-dev-middleware": "^2.0.4",
		"webpack-hot-middleware": "^2.21.0"
	}

	```
	In your terminal:

	```
	$ npm install
	$ mkdir server/build
	$ npm run build
	$ npm run start
	```

	In `package.json`, the following `build` script is saying compile the entire server directory and output it to the server/build directory. `-d` means directory.

	```
	"build": "babel server -d ./server/build"

	```
	If we didn't have the `.babelrc` then we have to make this the build script:
	```
	"build": babel server/app.js -o server/build/app.js --presets env,stage-2",
	```
	If we didn't have the scripts in `package.json`, then every time we make a change to `server.js`, we would have to transpile the code from ES6 to ES5 and manually run the babel transpiling command to populate the build folder then run the ES5 version of the folder.

	```
	$ babel babel server/app.js -o server/build/app.js --presets env,stage-2"
	$ nodemon server/app.js --watch server --exec babel-node
	```
